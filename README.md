# Project Overview

This project is primarily inspired by Crow's videos. => https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6EKDAKBXPs 

I introduced an automated PID search to eliminate the need for manual search.

Notably, the executable still maintains a good score on VirusTotal! (15/71) :D
With a good cryptor and better shellcode encoding, there's surely something to be done.
